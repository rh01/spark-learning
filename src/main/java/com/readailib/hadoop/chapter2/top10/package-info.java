 * Top10.java assumes that all K's are unique for all given inputs of (K,V).
 * This is optimal solution when all K's are unique.'

 *
 * Top10NonUnique.java assumes that all K's are non-unique for all given
 * inputs of (K,V).  This is a general solution, which finds top-N for
 * all unique and non-unique keys.
